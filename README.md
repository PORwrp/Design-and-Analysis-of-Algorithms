Design-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms
=================================

This repository consists of codes written during my undergraduate Design and Analysis of Algorithms course!
I will add the codes in seperate folders according to different topics and different labs and codes with multiple implementaions in different languages will be clubbed in single folders!

To Do
1. Elapsed time, gnuplot, graphviz
2. Heapsort vs Mergesort vs Quicksort 
3. Priority queues 
4. Bucketsort 
5. Order statistics 
6. Open hashing 
7. Huffman coding 
8. Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm 
9. Matrix chain multiplication 
10. Longest common sequence 
11. Closest pair of points 
12. Turnpike reconstruction 
13. Splay trees

Additional To do's include covering codes on
1. Greedy Algorithms
2. Dynamic Programming
